\begin{abstract}

  Reservation-based scheduling has successfully been used as a
  suitable technique to support complex real-time systems. In
  particular, the Constant Bandwidth Server (CBS) is one such
  technique that has received special attention recently. In this
  paper we evaluate by extensive simulation two CBS versions,
  corresponding to hard and soft reservation schemes. The latter makes
  use of background processor time but to do so it may decrease the
  server priority too much. While the former circumvents this problem,
  it follows stricter reservation rules. Results obtained from our
  simulation indicate that both schemes perform equivalently in some
  scenarios while in several others the soft version significantly
  outperforms the hard one. Such results are relevant for system
  designers who can better subsidize their implementation decisions.

  Técnicas de escalonamento por reserva de banda já foram usadas com
  sucesso para dar suporte a sistemas de tempo real complexos. Em
  particular, o \textit{Constant Bandwidth Server} (CBS) é uma dessas
  técnicas que tem recebido atenção especial recentemente. Nesse
  artigo avaliamos, por simulações, a performance de duas variantes do
  CBS, correspondentes a reservas de banda \textit{soft} e
  \textit{hard}. A primeira faz uso de tempo ocioso do processador,
  mas, para fazer isso, pode diminuir demais a prioridade do
  servidor. Enquanto a outra contorna esse problema, ela segue regras
  de reserva deveras estritas. Resultados das nossas simulações
  indicam que ambos os esquemas performam de forma equivalente em
  alguns cenários, enquanto em vários outros a versão \textit{soft} é
  significantemente melhor que a versão \textit{hard}. Esses
  resultados são relevantes para projetistas de sistemas, que podem
  usá-los para subsidizar suas decisões.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Real-time systems once structured as a set of simple periodic hard
tasks \cite{liu.ea73:scheduling} have become more complex. Nowadays
such systems are often composed of hard and soft real-time tasks, both
of which can be either periodic or non-periodic.  Usual requirements
of these modern real-time systems include not only predictability but
also responsiveness and adaptiveness. In this context,
reservation-based scheduling, \textbf{RBS} for short, has successfully
been applied to support such requirements
\cite{abeni.ea04:resource,mercer.ea94:processor,rajkumar.ea98:resource,sprunt.ea89:aperiodic,steffens.ea03:resource}.

RBS techniques are usually implemented by scheduling servers. A server
is a virtual task responsible for scheduling application tasks
assigned to it.  Each server $S$ is determined by a processor
reservation tuple, $(Q,T)$, where $Q$ is called the server capacity
and $T$ the server period.  If a task (or group of tasks) $\tau$ is
assigned to a server $S$, $\tau$ has the right to use $Q$ processor
time units within $T$ total time units. Hence, servers can then be
scheduled as if they were simple periodic tasks.

On top of its conceptual simplicity, RBS has several interesting
properties \cite{steffens.ea03:resource}. From the scheduling
viewpoint it is worthing mentioning that: (a) RBS is a means of
ensuring temporal isolation since task execution can be controlled
within its reservation envelope
\cite{abeni.ea04:resource,mercer.ea94:processor,sprunt.ea89:aperiodic,spuri.ea96:scheduling};
(b) it is possible to implement hierarchical scheduling when a group
of tasks share the same server
\cite{davis.ea05:hierarchical,davis.ea08:investigation}; (c) it can be
used to improve flexibility, responsiveness and adaptiveness at the
scheduler level.  Such characteristics have motivated considerable
research in the area
\cite{abeni.ea99:adaptive,caccamo.ea00:capacity,caccamo.ea05:efficient,oliveira.ea08:dynamic,oliveira.ea09:dynamic,lin.ea05:improving}.
In this paper we aim at better characterizing the performance of two
reservation schemes commonly implemented in real-time systems
\cite{perng.ea06:real}.

A reservation scheme is \textbf{hard} if a server $S = (Q,T)$ cannot
be scheduled to run for more than $Q$ time units within any time
interval of $T$ units even if there is idle processor time
available. On the other hand, a \textbf{soft} scheme allows $S$ to
execute beyond its reservation as long as system schedulability is not
compromised. Often the decision of implementing one of these schemes
arises. One of the widely known implementations of soft RBS scheme in
EDF scheduled systems is the Constant Bandwidth Server (\textbf{CBS})
\cite{abeni.ea04:resource}.  Due to the number of other scheduling
mechanisms based on CBS
\cite{abeni.ea05:qos,caccamo.ea00:capacity,caccamo.ea05:efficient,lipari.ea00:greedy},
we chose it as a case study in this paper.

According to the CBS rules, a constant bandwidth $u = Q/T$ is
allocated to each server $S = (Q,T)$, where $Q$ is called hereafter
the maximum server budget. The budget of each server $S$ is consumed
as its jobs are executed. To guarantee that the server obeys its
utilization limit, the deadline of $S$ is postponed by $T$ every time
its budget is depleted.  Its full budget $Q$ is also restored when its
deadline is updated.  Deadline postponements make it possible to
implement the soft reservation scheme but brings about a potential
side effect: an overloaded server may have its deadline postponed too
often making its relative priority too low.  This problem may be
avoided by implementing a hard reservation version of CBS
\cite{buttazzo05:soft}, which waits until the current server deadline
to recharge the server budget. In order to support implementation
decisions regarding hard and soft reservation schemes comparative
studies are still needed.

\subsection{Related work}
\label{sec:related-work}

There is extensive research on comparing RBS
techniques.  Some of them are based on fixed-priority scheduling
\cite{bernat.ea99:new,bernat.ea02:multiple,davis.ea05:hierarchical,davis.ea95:dual}.
In the field of dynamic scheduling, CBS has been compared to several
other approaches \cite{spuri.ea96:scheduling}.  Techniques to
reclaiming spare capacity of CBS have also been reported, bringing in
comparative studies on their performance
\cite{caccamo.ea00:capacity,lin.ea05:improving}. To the best of our
knowledge these comparative studies have considered only the soft
version of CBS, though.  The work by Rajkumar et
al. \cite{rajkumar.ea98:resource} illustrates the use of hard and soft
versions of a fixed-priority RBS using a very simple task set.

\subsection{Contributions of this paper}
\label{sec:contr-this-paper}

We report a comprehensive comparative study on the performance of
CBS. The reported evaluation puts into perspective the perceived
characteristics of its hard and soft reservation schemes.  By
benchmarking these two CBS versions in a simulation environment, they
are systematically compared against each other.  Since the use of CBS
has extensively been reported and one usually chooses arbitrarily
between these two versions (e.g. the work by Abeni et al. on adaptive
reservations and QoS \cite{abeni.ea99:adaptive,abeni.ea05:qos}), the
results reported here can better subsidize their implementation
decisions.  The reported study was carried out making use of the
real-time scheduling simulator \simul{}, implemented in
Pyton. Although there are other simulation tools
\cite{ancilotti.ea96:flexible}, implementing this simulator ourselves
allowed us to easily tune it to our specific requirements.

\subsection{Structure of this paper}
\label{sec:structure-this-paper}

A more precise definition of the CBS versions considered in this
paper is given in Section \ref{sec:soft-hard-cbs}. Some comments on the motivation for 
this study is also presented in this Section.  
Section \ref{sec:simul-envir} describes the system model and the
simulation environment.  In order to give a wide picture of the
simulated scheduling mechanisms, we conducted the evaluation taking
into consideration different simulation scenarios. Results from the
simulation are discussed in Section \ref{sec:simulation-results} while
in Section \ref{sec:conclusion} our final comments are given.

\section{Soft and Hard CBS}
\label{sec:soft-hard-cbs}

A CBS \cite{abeni.ea98:integrating} is defined by a tuple $(Q,T)$ and
by a set of rules. The server is allowed to run for $Q$ time units
over a period of $T$ time units. Whenever a job $j$ arrives at the
server, it is enqueued in the server queue. The server also maintains
internally a tuple $(c,d)$, where $c$ is its current budget and $d$ is
its current deadline. For each time unit a task spends running, the
value of $c$ is decreased by the same amount. The CBS is scheduled as
a normal task with deadline $d$ running on an EDF scheduler. The
release time of a job is named $r$. The CBS algorithm can be found in
Abeni et al.\cite{abeni.ea98:integrating}.

It is interesting to observe that the soft CBS trades availability for
priority.  Indeed, in the soft version, a server is always ready since
its budget is never kept null.  Nonetheless, the sever may have its
deadline postponed too much in periods where it is overloaded. If this
occurs, the server may wait in background for some time.  On the other
hand, the hard CBS does not suffer from this effect but may be kept
suspended for some time.  The characterization of these versions with
respect to their effects on applications will be reported in the
following Sections.
 
\section{Simulation Environment}
\label{sec:simul-envir}

To perform the experiments presented in this paper we implemented
\simul{}, a simple python-based simulator for real-time scheduling
algorithms. Its source code, the data files used in this paper and
instructions to reproduce our results are available in
\url{http://github.com/jamsjr/hard-versus-soft/tree/master}. \simul{}
implements a basic EDF scheduler and, on top of it, runs both hard
real-time periodic tasks and bandwidth reservation servers. These
servers can be either hard \cite{buttazzo05:soft} or soft CBS
\cite{abeni.ea98:integrating}, as previously described. Soft real-time
tasks running on these servers either have their execution times
sampled from a probability distribution or follow traces generated
from a modified version of the \texttt{FFMPEG} decoding library that
reports the start time and decoding cost for each frame in a
high-resolution video. The same time unit standard was used for both
the video trace and the synthetic task sets so that all presented
measurements are platform-independent.

Most simulations performed in this paper share a common set-up. There
is a periodic hard real-time task and one soft real-time server,
implementing either hard or soft reservation schemes. The server and
the task compete for processor according to EDF rules. The server is
monitored during the simulation so that both reservation schemes can
be compared against each other. This simple simulation set-up make it
easier to analyze the behavior of the system under different load and
configurations. More complex simulations, involving more servers and
tasks, were also tested. In both complex and simple simulation setups,
the behavior of the reservation schemes was shown to be similar. In
order to illustrate this, we also present results obtained by a more
complex simulation set-up.  In the following we define the
configurations and the server loads considered during the simulation.

\subsection{Simulation Configurations}
\label{sec:configurations}

In order to design our simulation to cover several different
application semantics, we have considered four basic load simulation
parameters:
\begin{description}
\item Discard/not discard expired tasks. For some applications it is
  better to discard tasks when they miss their deadlines while for
  other ones tasks are kept executing after their expired deadlines.
\item High/low execution cost variance. Execution cost variance plays
  an important role when tuning the server parameters. Server
  capacities are usually adjusted to the mean execution cost
  value. Varying this parameter we verify the behavior of the
  reservation schemes for these two extreme scenarios.
\item Overloaded/not overloaded system. We consider a system
  overloaded when its tasks demand more than 100\% of CPU.
\item Overloaded/not overloaded server. A server $S$ is overloaded
  when its utilization $u = Q/T$ is not enough to serve the tasks it
  is serving.
\end{description}

Considering all combination of these four parameters leads to 16
distinct configurations. In several of them the behaviors of both
reservation schemes were found to be equivalent.  For the ones in
which they are not equivalent, we grouped the possible configurations
into five scenarios. The metrics we used to evaluate the performance
of the servers are response time, wait time and deadline miss ratio.

\subsection{Characterizing the server load}
\label{sec:charact-server-load}

Five distinct application loads (\Lum{}-\Lcinco{}) were considered by varying the
execution cost distributions.  For the sake of data analysis, it is
interesting to observe how hard and soft reservation schemes behave
with more controlled load distributions. This is the goal of loads
\Lum{}-\Ltres{}, which takes synthetic generated data. The data correspond to
execution times of jobs to be served during $9,000$ time units of
simulation.  The inter-arrival time of these jobs were kept constant
and equal to one time unit.  The load \Lquatro{} was extracted from a movie
trace and was used to represent more realistic soft-real time
data. Load \Lcinco{} uses the same trace as load \Lquatro{} but runs 5 independent
servers competing for the processor. The characteristics of these five
load scenarios are given below.

\begin{description}
\item \Lum{}: Constant mean execution time and low variance. Job execution
  costs were generated during the simulation time, set to $9,000$ time
  units, according to a normal distribution with mean $0.4$ and (low)
  variance equal to $0.01$. In other words, the execution cost of each
  job to be served follows $\mathcal{N}(0.4,0.01)$. The background
  task, in this scenario, consumes 60\% of the processor time. The
  server's capacity is $0.4$ and its period is $1$ time unit.
\item \Ldois{}: Variable mean execution time and low variance.  In order to
  simulate controlled variation of execution times, two values for the
  mean execution time were considered, sampled from
  $\mathcal{N}(0.6,0.01)$ and $\mathcal{N}(0.4,0.01)$. During the time
  intervals $[0;3,000)$ and $(6,000;9,000]$ data drawn from the former
  were used while the latter distribution was used to generate data
  for interval $[3,000;6,000]$. This simulates scenarios were the
  application demands different execution times during certain phases
  of its execution. The background task, in this scenario, consumes
  60\% of the processor time. The server's capacity is $0.46$ and its
  period is $1$ time unit.
\item \Ltres{}: Constant mean execution time and variable variance.  Another
  simulated scenario considered two simulation intervals, $[0;4,500)$
  and $[4,500;9,000)$.  The execution costs for these intervals
  followed two distributions, $\mathcal{N}(0.5,0.01)$ and
  $\mathcal{N}(0.5,0.1)$. The background task consumes 50\% of the
  processor time, the server's capacity is $0.5$ and its period is $1$
  time unit.
\item \Lquatro{}: A movie trace. The execution cost distribution are shown in
  Figure \ref{fig:plotl4}. The values in the graph correspond to the
  decoding times using the \texttt{FFMPEG} video decoding library for
  the Eve movie. In this trace jobs arrive with a mean period of 0.072
  time units and mean costs of 0.0064 time units. This trace is
  considered for the purpose of testing the behavior of both
  reservation schemes with a real-life data set. The background task
  consumes 90\% of the processor time. The server's capacity is
  $0.0065$ and its period is $0.072$ time units.
\item \Lcinco{}: A complex scenario. Five competing servers, each with the
  same task set as scenario \Lquatro{}. Each server has capacity $0.0065$ and
  period $0.072$, and the background task takes 50\% of the processor
  time.

\section{Simulation Results}
\label{sec:simulation-results}

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:configurations}, not all
configurations led to a performance difference. Section
\ref{sec:noDifference} first presents some comments on the reasons for
this behavior, and then, Section \ref{sec:indiv-simul-results}
describes the results that highlight any differences in performance
between the hard and soft reservation schemes.

\subsection{Equivalent Reservation Performance}
\label{sec:noDifference}

In configurations where expired tasks are not discarded, the system is
constantly overloaded or the server is underloaded both reservation
schemes performed equivalently. The explanation for this behavior is
given below.

\subsubsection{Not Discarding expired tasks}
\label{sec:disc-expir-tasks}

Consider a server $S = (Q,T)$ and that at time $t$ there is a
execution cost of $C$ to be served.  Since expired tasks are not
discarded, both hard and soft reservation servers will finish in at
least $\lfloor C/Q \rfloor T$ time units.  The only possible
difference is that a soft reservation server might spend this budget
before a hard reservation server can. In that case, the soft
reservation server may suffer some deadline postponements, but can
never finish executing a given job after an equivalent hard
reservation server. Hence, in general, not discarding expired tasks
makes soft and hard reservation completely equivalent, and we will
omit the results for the simulations that do not discard expired
tasks.

\subsubsection{Overloaded system}
\label{sec:system-load}

When the system is always perfectly dimensioned or overloaded (there
is no system idle time, or, equivalently, all the demand for the
servers plus the background tasks is more than 1) both reservation
schemes are equivalent. This is so because a soft reservation server
will only use extra budget obtained by postponing its deadline when
there are no other tasks with a higher priority than its next
deadline, and this situation is unlikely in an overloaded system. For
this reason we only report the results of underloaded and correctly
dimensioned systems.

\subsubsection{Underloaded server}
\label{sec:server-load}

Another scenario that does not highlight any significant differences
between hard and soft reservation is when the server load is low
enough so that there is usually free budget upon completing a task. In
these situations both hard and soft reservation mechanisms are
equivalent, because, as less budget is needed per server period than
the server capacity, there will be very infrequent budget
exhaustion.

\subsection{Unequivalent Performance}
\label{sec:indiv-simul-results}

Table \ref{tab:summary} summarizes the simulation results for the
previously described scenarios. In our simulations we do not monitor
the background hard real-time task, since its hitting all its
deadlines is guaranteed by our usage of the EDF algorithm and the
system utilization being kept below 1. It can be easily seen that a
soft reservation server has usually a much smaller deadline miss ratio
than a hard reservation server in the same scenario. In scenario \Lcinco{},
the table shows the mean response time, wait time and deadline miss
ratio over all five servers in that scenario. The mean response times
are mostly similar, except for scenarios \Lquatro{} and \Lcinco{}. It is important to
note that comparing mean response time of servers with different
deadline miss ratios is not reliable, since a server can always reduce
its mean response time by failing to serve more demanding
tasks. Hence, a more realiable picture of how the servers behave under
each scenario can be pieced by looking at the mean wait time and the
deadline miss ratio. These metrics show that a soft reservation server
outperforms a hard reservation server in all simulated scenarios. The
next sections go over each scenario in higher detail. All these
scenarios are run discarding completed tasks.

\subsubsection{Scenario \Lum{}}
\label{sec:scenario-l1}

\begin{figure}[t]

    \label{fig:hard-dth}
  }
  \caption{Wait time histograms for scenario \Lum{}.}
  \label{fig:dth}
\end{figure}

A general idea of how soft and hard reservation can behave might be
given by a simulation with the costs in scenario \Lum{}. Since the
distribution of the execution costs is normal and constant throughout
the simulation, the distribution of response and wait times is better
characterized by a histogram. These are shown in Figures \ref{fig:rth}
and \ref{fig:dth}. In each graph, the horizontal axis represents each
possible value, in time units, for the response or waiting times,
while the vertical axis counts how many times each such value has
actually occurred. In this scenario, the soft reservation server
missed 5.4\% of the deadlines and the hard reservation server missed
59.8\%, as seen in Table \ref{tab:summary}. In Figure \ref{fig:rth},
the two modes of the distributions represent the response times for
when the task executes immediately (the peaks around $0.4$) and when
it is delayed by the background task (the peaks around $1.0$). Tasks
that are delayed by more than that miss their deadlines.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \label{fig:hard-trifasico}
  }
  \caption{Response times for scenario \Ldois{}.}
  \label{fig:trifasico}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scenario \Ldois{}}
\label{sec:scenario-l2}

In this experiment, the task set first starts with a correctly
dimensioned server, until time $t=3000$, when the mean costs for the
tasks rise suddenly. After a while, the costs return to normal. Figure
\ref{fig:trifasico} shows the response times for this scenario. The
wait times, not shown specifically, follow a similar pattern. It is
good to note that, as seen in figure \ref{fig:hard-trifasico}, all
tasks in the higher demand section are discarded by the hard
reservation server due to deadline missing.  Each point $(x,y)$ in the
graph represents a task that, finishing at time $x$, had a response
time of $y$. Therefore, when the same area is denser in one graph (as
happens in the middle section of this scenario), it means that the
server with a higher density completed more tasks. This kind of graph,
while not precisely describing the distribution of the response times,
shows a clear picture of how they change over time. As this figure
shows, in the heavily loaded part only the soft reservation server can
finish tasks that need more than the server budget. This suggests that
the soft reservation server is better able to cope with run-time
varying requirements. Also, when the load comes back down there is no
extra cost for the soft reservation server, and its response times are
equivalent to the response times for the hard reservation
server. Thus, in variable environments a soft reservation scheme seems
more suitable for situations where the application load changes over
time. This information might be relevant for soft real-time systems
running some adaptation mechanism, such as the one described by Abeni
et al. \cite{abeni.ea05:qos}.

\begin{figure}[t]

  \subfloat[Soft reservation.]{
    \includegraphics[scale=0.26]{variance-1}

    \label{fig:hard-variance}
  }
  \caption{Response times for scenario \Ltres{}.}
  \label{fig:variance}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scenario \Ltres{}}
\label{sec:scenario-l3}

Another possible situation in which a RBS server might have its
responsivity compromised is when dealing with tasks having a high
variance in its execution costs. Scenario \Ltres{} was designed to test this
possibility. This might happen because to serve tasks with
unexpectedly high costs, a soft reservation server might need to
postpone its deadline too much, while a hard reservation server would
be more prudent and instead discard these costly outliers, being more
performant in the remaining time. In this experiment the hard
reservation server missed 59.39\% of the deadlines, while the soft
reservation only missed 5.19\%. Figure \ref{fig:variance} shows the
response times for this experiment. The wait times behaved similarly
and were omitted from this paper. As can be easily seen, in the
higher variance part the soft reservation server manages to finish
many more tasks in a short amount of time than the hard reservation
server, thus behaving better on task sets with a high variance.

\label{sec:scenario-l4}

Another very important test case is whether, in non-synthetic tasks,
the performance characteristics we observed are reproduced. In this
experiment, we ran both a soft reservation server and a hard
reservation server on scenario \Lquatro{}. Figure \ref{fig:eve} shows the wait
time for both a hard and a soft reservation servers running this task
set. The response time follows a similar pattern and can be ommitted
from this paper. As can be easily seen, the wait time for the hard
reservation server is always higher than for the soft reservation
server, sometimes high enough that the task has already missed its
deadline by the time it starts executing. This might account for the
fact that, as can be seen in Table \ref{tab:summary}, the soft
reservation server only missed 0.1\% of the deadlines, while the hard
reservation server missed 24.54\%. This result seems, at first,
counter-intuitive, since the soft reservation server, by delaying its
deadline whenever the execution costs are too high, can have an
arbitrarily low priority. On the other hand, the same task will take
more overall time to be served with a hard reservation server, since
it will have to wait for capacity replenishment before continuing
execution. Therefore, on average, the soft reservation scheme seems
more responsive.

\subsubsection{Scenario \Lcinco{}}
\label{sec:scenario-l5}

This scenario aims to show that increasing the complexity of the
situation does not change perceptively the characteristics of hard and
soft reservation. As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:summary}, the mean
deadline miss ratio of the hard reservation servers is still
substantially higher than the mean deadline miss ratio of the soft
reservation servers. Indeed, the trends observed for scenario \Lquatro{} are
replicated.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Reservation-based scheduling has been increasingly used to support
modern soft and hard real-time systems. Some implementations of both
hard and soft reservation schemes have been proposed in real-time
operating systems.

In this paper we have conducted a systematic study on the performance
of soft and hard reservation schemes. As we have seen, both
reservation schemes present equivalent performance for several
configurations, but, using simple but illustrative load scenarios, we
have shown that soft reservation schemes outperforms the hard one by
having shorter response times, substantially shorter wait times and
significantly smaller deadline miss ratios. These results suggest that
soft reservation servers are better able to use system resources
without either compromising overall system schedulability or task
quality of service. We believe that the results and scenarios
presented here can be used by designers to support their
implementation decisions.

\begin{abstract}

  Reservation-based scheduling has successfully been used as a
  suitable technique to support complex real-time systems. In
  particular, the Constant Bandwidth Server (CBS) is one such
  technique that has received special attention recently. In this
  paper we evaluate by extensive simulation two CBS versions,
  corresponding to hard and soft reservation schemes. The latter makes
  use of background processor time but to do so it may decrease the
  server priority too much. While the former circumvents this problem,
  it follows stricter reservation rules. Results obtained from our
  simulation indicate that both schemes perform equivalently in some
  scenarios while in several others the soft version significantly
  outperforms the hard one. Such results are relevant for system
  designers who can better subsidize their implementation decisions.

\Section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Real-time systems once structured as a set of
simple periodic hard tasks \cite{liu.ea73:scheduling} have become more
complex. Nowadays such systems are often composed of hard and soft
real-time tasks, both of which can be either periodic or non-periodic.
Usual requirements of these modern real-time systems include not only
predictability but also responsiveness and adaptiveness. In this
context, reservation-based scheduling, \textbf{RBS} for short, has
successfully been applied to support such requirements
\cite{abeni.ea04:resource,mercer.ea94:processor,rajkumar.ea98:resource,sprunt.ea89:aperiodic,steffens.ea03:resource}.

RBS techniques are usually implemented by scheduling servers. A server
is a virtual task responsible for scheduling application tasks
assigned to it.  Each server $S$ is determined by a processor
reservation tuple, $(Q,T)$, where $Q$ is called the server capacity
and $T$ the server period.  If a task (or group of tasks) $\tau$ is
assigned to a server $S$, $\tau$ has the right to use $Q$ processor
time within $T$ time units. Hence, servers can then be scheduled as if
they were simple periodic tasks.

On top of its conceptual simplicity, RBS has several interesting
properties \cite{steffens.ea03:resource}. From the scheduling
viewpoint it is worthing mentioning that: (a) RBS is a means of
ensuring temporal isolation since task execution can be controlled
within its reservation envelope
\cite{abeni.ea04:resource,mercer.ea94:processor,sprunt.ea89:aperiodic,spuri.ea96:scheduling};
(b) it is possible to implement hierarchical scheduling when a group
of tasks share the same server
\cite{davis.ea05:hierarchical,davis.ea08:investigation}; (c) it can be
used to improve flexibility, responsiveness and adaptiveness at the
scheduler level.  Such characteristics have motivated considerable
research in the area
\cite{abeni.ea99:adaptive,caccamo.ea00:capacity,caccamo.ea05:efficient,oliveira.ea08:dynamic,oliveira.ea09:dynamic,lin.ea05:improving}.
In this paper we aim at better characterizing the performance of two
reservation schemes commonly implemented in real-time systems
\cite{perng.ea06:real}.

A reservation scheme is \textbf{hard} if a server $S = (Q,T)$ cannot
be scheduled to run for more than $Q$ time units within any time
interval of $T$ units even if there is idle processor time
available. On the other hand, a \textbf{soft} scheme allows $S$ to
execute beyond its reservation as long as system schedulability is not
compromised. Often the decision of implementing one of these schemes
arises. One of the widely known implementations of soft RBS scheme in
EDF scheduled systems is the Constant Bandwidth Server (\textbf{CBS})
\cite{abeni.ea04:resource}.  Due to the number of other scheduling
mechanisms based on CBS
\cite{abeni.ea05:qos,caccamo.ea00:capacity,caccamo.ea05:efficient,lipari.ea00:greedy},
we chose it as a case study in this paper.

According to the CBS rules, a constant bandwidth $u = Q/T$ is
allocated to each server $S = (Q,T)$, where $Q$ is called hereafter
the maximum server budget. The budget of each server $S$ is consumed
as its jobs are executed. To guarantee that the server obeys its
utilization limit, the deadline of $S$ is postponed by $T$ every time
its budget is depleted.  Its full budget $Q$ is also restored when its
deadline is updated.  Deadline postponements make it possible to
implement the soft reservation scheme but brings about a potential
side effect: an overloaded server may have its deadline postponed too
often making its relative priority too low.  This problem may be
avoided by implementing a hard reservation version of CBS
\cite{buttazzo05:soft}, which waits until the current server deadline
to recharge the server budget. In order to support implementation
decisions regarding hard and soft reservation schemes comparative
studies are still needed.

\SubSection{Related work}

There is extensive research on comparing RBS
techniques.  Some of them are based on fixed-priority scheduling
\cite{bernat.ea99:new,bernat.ea02:multiple,davis.ea05:hierarchical,davis.ea95:dual}.
In the field of dynamic scheduling, CBS has been compared to several
other approaches \cite{spuri.ea96:scheduling}.  Techniques to
reclaiming spare capacity of CBS have also been reported, bringing in
comparative studies on their performance
\cite{caccamo.ea00:capacity,lin.ea05:improving}. To the best of our
knowledge these comparative studies have considered only the soft
version of CBS, though.  The work by Rajkumar et
al. \cite{rajkumar.ea01:resource} illustrates the use of hard and soft
versions of a fixed-priority RBS using a very simple task set.

\SubSection{Contributions of this paper}
\label{sec:contr-this-paper}

We report a comprehensive comparative study on the performance of
CBS. The reported evaluation puts into perspective the perceived
characteristics of its hard and soft reservation schemes.  By
benchmarking these two CBS versions in a simulation environment, they
are systematically compared against each other.  Since the use of CBS
has extensively been reported and one usually chooses arbitrarily
between these two versions (e.g. the work by Abeni et al. on adaptive
reservations and QoS \cite{abeni.ea99:adaptive,abeni.ea05:qos}), the
results reported here can better subsidize their implementation
decisions.  The reported study was carried out making use of the
real-time scheduling simulator \simul{}, implemented in
Pyton. Although there are other simulation tools
\cite{ancilotti.ea96:flexible}, implementing this simulator ourselves
allowed us to easily tune it to our specific requirements.

\SubSection{Structure of this paper}
\label{sec:structure-this-paper}

A more precise definition of the CBS versions considered in this
paper is given in section \ref{sec:soft-hard-cbs}. Some comments on the motivation for 
this study is also presented in this section.  
Section \ref{sec:simul-envir} describes the system model and the
simulation environment.  In order to give a wide picture of the
simulated scheduling mechanisms, we conducted the evaluation taking
into consideration different simulation scenarios. Results from the
simulation are discussed in Section \ref{sec:simulation-results} while
in Section \ref{sec:conclusion} our final comments are given.

\Section{Soft and Hard CBS}
\label{sec:soft-hard-cbs}

A CBS \cite{abeni.ea98:integrating} is defined by a tuple $(Q,T)$ and
by a set of rules. The server is allowed to run for $Q$ time units
over a period of $T$ time units. Whenever a job $j$ arrives at the
server, it is enqueued in the server queue. The server also maintains
internally a tuple $(c,d)$, where $c$ is its current budget and $d$ is
its current deadline. For each time unit a task spends running, the
value of $c$ is decreased. The CBS is scheduled as a normal task with
deadline $d$ running on an EDF scheduler. The release time of a job is
named $r$. The CBS algorithm is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Whenever the server is scheduling a new job for execution, it
  tests whether $r + (c/Q)T \geq d$. If this is true, then the current
  deadline $d$ is set to $r+T$ and the capacity is set to
  $Q$. Otherwise, the deadline $d$ and the capacity $c$ are unchanged.
\item When the capacity $c$ becomes $0$, two rules may be applied
  depending on the CBS version:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Soft CBS. The deadline $d$ is set to $d+T$
    and the capacity $c$ is set to $Q$;
  \item Hard CBS. The server waits until time $d$ and then sets the
    deadline $d$ to $d+T$ and the capacity $c$ to $Q$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

It is interesting to observe that the soft CBS trades availability for
priority.  Indeed, in the soft version, a server is always ready since
its budget is never kept null.  Nonetheless, the sever may have its
deadline postponed too much in periods where it is overloaded. If this
occurs, the server may wait in background for some time.  On the other
hand, the hard CBS does not suffer from this effect but may be kept
suspended for some time.  The characterization of these versions with
respect to their effects on applications will be reported in the
following sections.
 
\Section{Simulation Environment}
\label{sec:simul-envir}

To perform the experiments presented in this paper we implemented
\simul{}, a simple python-based simulator for real-time scheduling
algorithms. Its source code, the data files used in this paper and
instructions to reproduce our results are available in
\url{http://github.com/jamsjr/hard-versus-soft/tree/master}. \simul{}
implements a basic EDF scheduler and, on top of it, runs both hard
real-time periodic tasks and bandwidth reservation servers. These
servers can be either hard \cite{buttazzo05:soft} or soft CBS
\cite{abeni.ea98:integrating}, previously described. Soft real-time
tasks running on these servers either have their execution times
sampled from a probability distribution or follow traces generated
from a modified version of the \texttt{FFMPEG} decoding library that
reports the start time and decoding cost for each frame in a
high-resolution video. The same time unit standard was used for both
the video trace and the synthetic task sets so that all presented
measurements are platform-independent.

All the simulations performed in this paper share a common
set-up. There is a periodic hard real-time task running in the
background and one soft real-time server, implementing either hard or
soft reservation schemes.  This server will be monitored during the
simulation so that both reservation schemes can be compared against
each other. More complex simulations, involving more servers and
tasks, were also tested. In both complex and simple simulation
set-ups, the behavior of the reservation schemes was shown to be
similar. Hence, we chose to present here the simplest simulation
set-up for the sake of data analysis and also one more complex
scenario to suggest that these results are reproducible in real-life.
Several configurations of this set-up were considered.

\SubSection{Simulation Configurations}
\label{sec:configurations}

In order to design our simulation to cover several different
application semantics, we have considered four basic load simulation
parameters:
\begin{description}
\item Discard/not discard expired tasks. For some applications it is
  better to discard tasks when they miss their deadlines while for
  other ones tasks are kept executing after their expired deadlines.
\item High/low execution cost variance. Execution cost variance plays
  an important role when tuning the server parameters. Server
  capacities are usually adjusted to the mean execution cost
  value. Varying this parameter we verify the behavior of the
  reservation schemes for these two extreme scenarios.
\item Overloaded/not overloaded system. We consider a system
  overloaded when its tasks demand more than 100\% of CPU.
\item Overloaded/not overloaded server. A server $S$ is overloaded
  when its utilization $u = Q/T$ is not enough to serve the tasks it
  is serving.
\end{description}

The metrics we used to evaluate the performance of the servers are
response time, wait time and deadline miss ratio. For a given job that
completes, its \textbf{response time} is the time interval between the
time it arrived and the time it completed executing. The response time
for a job that misses its deadline and is discarded is undefined. A
job's \textbf{wait time} is defined as the time interval between its
arrival time and the time it started executing. For a server, its
\textbf{deadline miss ratio} is the fraction $l/t$, where $l$ is the
number of jobs that missed their deadlines and $t$ is the total number
of jobs scheduled for that server.

Considering all combination of these four parameters leads to 16
distinct configurations. In several of them the behaviors of both
reservation schemes were found to be equivalent.  For the ones in
which they are not equivalent, we grouped the possible configurations
into five scenarios.

\SubSection{Characterizing the server load}
\label{sec:charact-server-load}

Five distinct application loads (L1-L5) were considered by varying the
execution cost distributions.  For the sake of data analysis, it is
interesting to observe how hard and soft reservation schemes behave
with more controlled load distributions. This is the goal of loads
L1-L3, which takes synthetic generated data. The data correspond to
execution times of jobs to be served during $9,000$ time units of
simulation.  The inter-arrival time of these jobs were kept constant
and equal to one time unit.  The load L4 was taken by a movie trace
and was used to represent more realistic soft-real time data. Load L5
uses the same trace as load L4 but runs 5 independent servers
competing for the processor. The characteristics of these five load
scenarios are given below.

\begin{description}
\item L1: Constant mean execution time and low variance. Job execution
  costs were generated during the simulation time, set to $9,000$ time
  units, according to a normal distribution with mean $0.4$ and (low)
  variance equal to $0.01$. In other words, the execution cost of each
  job to be served follows $\mathcal{N}(0.4,0.01)$. This scenario can
  be seen in Figure \ref{fig:plotl1}. The background task, in this
  scenario, consumes 60\% of the processor time. The server's capacity
  is $0.4$ and its period is $1$ time unit.
\item L2: Variable mean execution time and low variance.  In order to
  simulate controlled variation of execution times, two values for the
  mean execution time were considered, taken from
  $\mathcal{N}(0.6,0.01)$ and $\mathcal{N}(0.4,0.01)$. During the time
  intervals $[0;3,000)$ and $(6,000;9,000]$ data drawn from the former
  were used while the latter distribution was used to generate data
  for interval $[3,000;6,000]$. This simulates scenarios were the
  application demands different execution times during certain phases
  of its execution. This scenario is displayed in Figure
  \ref{fig:plotl2}. The background task, in this scenario, consumes
  60\% of the processor time. The server's capacity is $0.46$ and its
  period is $1$ time unit.
\item L3: Constant mean execution time and variable variance.  Another
  simulated scenario considered two simulation intervals, $[0;4,500)$
  and $[4,500;9,000)$.  The execution costs for these intervals
  followed two distributions, $\mathcal{N}(0.5,0.01)$ and
  $\mathcal{N}(0.5,0.1)$. This scenario is displayed in Figure
  \ref{fig:plotl3}. The background task consumes 50\% of the processor
  time, the server's capacity is $0.5$ and its period is $1$ time unit.
\item L4: A movie trace. The execution cost distribution are shown in
  Figure \ref{fig:plotl4}. The values in the graph correspond to the
  decoding times using the \texttt{FFMPEG} video decoding library for
  the Eve movie. In this trace jobs arrive with a mean period of 0.072
  time units and mean costs of 0.0064 time units. This trace is
  considered for the purpose of testing the behavior of both
  reservation schemes with a real-life data set. The background task
  consumes 90\% of the processor time. The server's capacity is
  $0.0065$ and its period is $0.072$ time units.
\item L5: A complex scenario. To confirm the thesis that these results
  are reproducible in more complex scenarios, we ran five competing
  servers, each with the same task set as scenario L4. Each server has
  capacity $0.0065$ and period $0.072$, and the background task takes
  50\% of the processor time.

\Section{Simulation Results}
\label{sec:simulation-results}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:configurations}, not all
configurations led to a performance difference. Section
\ref{sec:noDifference} first presents some comments on the reasons for
this behavior, and then, section \ref{sec:indiv-simul-results}
describes the results that highlight any differences in performance
between the hard and soft reservation schemes.

\SubSection{Equivalent Reservation Performance}
\label{sec:noDifference}

In configurations where expired tasks are not discarded, the system is
constantly overloaded or the server is underloaded both reservation
schemes performed equivalently. The explanation for this behavior is
given below.

\subsubsection{Not Discarding expired tasks}
\label{sec:disc-expir-tasks}

Consider a server $S = (Q,T)$ and that at time $t$ there is a
execution cost of $C$ to be served.  Since expired tasks are not
discarded, both hard and soft reservation servers will finish in at
least $\lfloor C/Q \rfloor T$ time units.  The only possible
difference is that a soft reservation server might spend this budget
before a hard reservation server can. In that case, the soft
reservation server may suffer some deadline postponements, but can
never finish executing a given job after an equivalent hard
reservation server. Hence, in general, not discarding expired tasks
makes soft and hard reservation completely equivalent.

\subsubsection{Overloaded system}
\label{sec:system-load}

When the system is always perfectly dimensioned or overloaded (there
is no system idle time) both reservation schemes are equivalent. This
is so because a soft reservation server will only use extra budget
obtained by postponing its deadline when there are no other tasks with
a higher priority than its next deadline, and this situation is
unlikely in an overloaded system.

\subsubsection{Underloaded server}
\label{sec:server-load}

Another scenario that does not highlight any significant differences
between hard and soft reservation is when the server load is low
enough so that there is usually free budget upon completing a task. In
these situations both hard and soft reservation mechanisms are
equivalent, because, as less budget is needed per server period than
the server capacity, there will be very infrequent budget
exhaustion.

\SubSection{Unequivalent Performance}
\label{sec:indiv-simul-results}

Table \ref{tab:summary} summarizes the simulation results for the
previously described scenarios. It can be easily seen that a soft
reservation server has usually a much smaller deadline miss ratio than
a hard reservation server in the same scenario. In scenario L5, the
table shows the mean response time, wait time and deadline miss ratio
over all five servers in that scenario. The mean response times are
mostly similar, except for scenarios L4 and L5, but it is important to
note that comparing mean response time of servers with different
deadline miss ratios is not reliable, since a server can always reduce
its mean response time by failing to serve more demanding
tasks. Hence, a more realiable picture of how the servers behave under
each scenario can be pieced by looking at the mean wait time and the
deadline miss ratio. These metrics show that a soft reservation server
outperforms a hard reservation server in all simulated scenarios. The
next sections go over each scenario in higher detail.

\subsubsection{Scenario L1}
\label{sec:scenario-l1}

    \label{fig:hard-dth}
  }
  \caption{Wait time histograms for scenario L1.}
  \label{fig:dth}
\end{figure}

A general idea of how soft and hard reservation can behave might be
given by a simulation with the costs in scenario L1. Since the
distribution of the execution costs is normal and constant throughout
the simulation, the distribution of response and wait times is better
characterized by a histogram. These are shown in Figures \ref{fig:rth}
and \ref{fig:dth}. In each graph, the horizontal axis represents each
possible value, in time units, for the response or waiting times,
while the vertical axis counts how many times each such value has
actually occurred. In this scenario, the soft reservation server
missed 5.4\% of the deadlines and the hard reservation server missed
59.8\%, as seen in Table \ref{tab:summary}. These histograms highlight
behavior reproduced in more complex scenarios. In Figure
\ref{fig:rth}, the two modes of the distributions represent the
response times for when the task executes immediately (the peaks
around $0.4$) and when it is delayed by the background task (the peaks
around $1.0$). Tasks that are delayed by more than that miss their
deadlines. An idea of how many tasks miss their deadlines can be seen
by looking at Figure \ref{fig:dth}, since every task in the third peak
(the one around $1.0$) in the histograms will miss its deadline.

    \label{fig:hard-trifasico}
  }
  \caption{Response times for scenario L2.}
  \label{fig:trifasico}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scenario L2}
\label{sec:scenario-l2}

In this experiment, the task set first starts with a correctly
dimensioned server, until time $t=3000$, when the mean costs for the
tasks rise suddenly. After a while, the costs return to normal. Figure
\ref{fig:trifasico} shows the response times for this scenario. The
wait times, not shown specifically, follow a similar pattern. Each
point $(x,y)$ in the graph represents a task that, finishing at time
$x$, had a response time of $y$. Therefore, when the same area is
denser in one graph (as happens in the middle section of this
scenario), it means that the server with a higher density completed
more tasks. This kind of graph, while not precisely describing the
distribution of the response times, shows a clear picture of how they
change over time. As this figure shows, in the heavily loaded part
only the soft reservation server can finish tasks that need more than
the server budget. This suggests that the soft reservation server is
better able to cope with run-time varying requirements. Also, when the
load comes back down there is no extra cost for the soft reservation
server, and its response times are equivalent to the response times
for the hard reservation server. Thus, in variable environments a soft
reservation scheme seems more suitable for situations where the
application load changes over time. This information might be relevant
for soft real-time systems running some adaptation mechanism, such as
the one described by Abeni et al. \cite{abeni.ea05:qos}.

    \label{fig:hard-variance}
  }
  \caption{Response times for scenario L3.}
  \label{fig:variance}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scenario L3}
\label{sec:scenario-l3}

Another possible situation in which a RBS server might have its
responsivity compromised is when dealing with tasks having a high
variance in its execution costs. Scenario L3 was designed to test this
possibility. This might happen because to serve tasks with
unexpectedly high costs, a soft reservation server might need to
postpone its deadline too much, while a hard reservation server would
be more prudent and instead discard these costly outliers, being more
performant in the remaining time. In this experiment the hard
reservation server missed 59.39\% of the deadlines, while the soft
reservation only missed 5.19\%. Figure \ref{fig:variance} shows the
response times for this experiment. The wait times behaved similarly
and were omitted from this paper. As can be easily seen, in the
higher variance part the soft reservation server manages to finish
many more tasks in a short amount of time than the hard reservation
server, thus behaving better on task sets with a high variance.

\subsubsection{Scenario L4}
\label{sec:scenario-l4}

Another very important test case is whether, in non-synthetic tasks,
the performance characteristics we observed are reproduced. In this
experiment, we ran both a soft reservation server and a hard
reservation server on scenario L4. Figure \ref{fig:eve} shows the wait
time for both a hard and a soft reservation servers running this task
set. The response time follows a similar pattern and can be ommitted
from this paper. As can be easily seen, the wait time for the hard
reservation server is always higher than for the soft reservation
server, sometimes high enough that the task has already missed its
deadline by the time it starts executing. This might account for the
fact that, as can be seen in Table \ref{tab:summary}, the soft
reservation server only missed 0.1\% of the deadlines, while the hard
reservation server missed 24.54\%. This result seems, at first,
counter-intuitive, since the soft reservation server, by delaying its
deadline whenever the execution costs are too high, can have an
arbitrarily low priority. On the other hand, the same task will take
more overall time to be served with a hard reservation server, since
it will have to wait for capacity replenishment before continuing
execution. Therefore, on average, the soft reservation scheme seems
more responsive.

\subsubsection{Scenario L5}
\label{sec:scenario-l5}

This scenario aims to show that increasing the complexity of the
situation does not change perceptively the characteristics of hard and
soft reservation. As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:summary}, the mean
deadline miss ratio of the hard reservation servers is still
substantially higher than the mean deadline miss ratio of the soft
reservation servers. Also, all results observed in scenario L4 are
replicated.

\Section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Reservation-based scheduling has been increasingly used to support
modern soft and hard real-time systems. Some implementations of both
hard and soft reservation schemes have been proposed in real-time
operating systems.

In this paper we have conducted a systematic study on the performance
of soft and hard reservation schemes. As we have seen, both
reservation schemes present equivalent performance for several
configurations, but, using simple but illustrative load scenarios, we
have shown that soft reservation schemes outperforms the hard one by
having shorter response times, substantially shorter wait times and
significantly smaller deadline miss ratios. These results suggest that
soft reservation servers are better able to use system resources
without either compromising overall system schedulability or task
quality of service. We believe that the results and scenarios
presented here can be used by designers to support their
implementation decisions.

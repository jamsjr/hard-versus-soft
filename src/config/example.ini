description: This simulation is a sample configuration file. Please
  edit whichever section you find relevant and use it to run your own
  simulation. It, as it is, simply runs the trace for the movie "eve"
  on a soft cbs server, with a hard real-time task running in the
  background. The comments in this file serve as a guide to specifying
  your own simulations.
